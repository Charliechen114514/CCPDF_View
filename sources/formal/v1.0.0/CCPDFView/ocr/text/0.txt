Function Templates

This chapter introduces function templates. Function templates are functions that are parameterized
So that they represent a family of functions.

11 AFirst Look atFunction Templates

Function templates provide a fonctional behavior that can be called for different types，In other

Words, a function template represents a family of functions.The representation looks a lot like an
ordinary fnction, except that Some elements of the fonction are leff undetermined: These elements

are parameterized. To iustrate, lef's look at a simple example-

1LL1 Defining the Template

The following is a function template that returns the maximum of two values-

bastcs/mazl.hpp

teamplate<typename T>

Taax (Ta Tb)

{
ViPmbcathenyieldaekseyieldb
return b<a?al:bi

】

This template definition specifies a family of functions that return the maximum of two values, which
are passed as function parameters a and b.! The type of these parameters is left open as emplale

1 Note that the max() template according to [SrepanovNores] intentionally retums "b <a? a : b "instead of
“ak<b?b: antoensure that the function behaves corectly even 话the two values are equivalent but not
equal
